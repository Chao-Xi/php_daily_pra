4.Interface Segration similar to substitution principle
   claases that implements interface should not be forced to implement methods that they dont use

   example. 1)birdinterface contains one method fly()
            2)parrot can fly, so implements birdinterface
            3)penguin doesn't fly, so dont have to implments the birdinterface
